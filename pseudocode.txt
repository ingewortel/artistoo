Two levels of stochastic correction:

mt vesicle vs mt vesicle (solves conflict of mtDNA vs ∆mtDNA)
cell vs cell (solves conflict of nucleus vs mitochondrial pop)

Key assumptions:
    mitochondrial fission is to create variation of mitochondrial products
        select healthy mtDNA
    mitochondrial fusion is to homogenize for nuclear products
        replication can only happen with a relatively full nuclear machinery in your mt vesicle
    cell growth is a product of ∆Psi and membrane area, can be used for mt-replication and self-replication 

-----

The current implementation in the pseudocode at the bottom is not reasonable in assessing quality.
Other options:
    The plan is that both mt_products and nuc_mt_products are encoded as copies each with their own quality
    The rate of oxphos/DNA replication is is the best copy of the worst step.
    This may encode diversity to win, while still keeping detrimental effects of poor DNA - in line with biology
Or:
    Do not encode quality, but just presence?
    And do as many paths as the rate-limiting step allows
Or:
    Pick as many random paths with rate-limiting qualities as possible

questions

How should quality of mt_products and nuc_mt_products be encoded?
Which processes need to be modeled and how are they split between mt and nuc?
    do the nuclear products share in oxphos?
    Is it important that translation of oxphos products is mt encoded? - i.e. does it have to be explicitly modeled?
    You could also split nuc_mt_products for replication and biogenesis - do you need to link biogenesis to host volume?
What makes mt growth/biogenesis?? - currently this is nuclear regulated in humans

---

Additional options:
    link oxphos quality and dna damage
    set a target surface/vol to get mt shape in CPM
